# JetsProject

In this project. The cohort has been instructed to make an Airfield with a variety of Jets. With the functionallity to Add, Remove, and give certain information to the computer to store. To Load the Cargo Jets. Conduct arial combat. And even discover certain details about vehicles you wouldnt know, if not having the use of a beautiful menu.

This certain project felt like a brief introduction for what is to come in the near future, more challenges, more obstacles. That can only be met and completed with repetition. Which is what ive been learning to do. 
Is to focus, recognize the patterns, and not be completely at a lost. Compared to the last project, this one did seem a bit easier, as weve been practicing these functions in Labs, Drills, and in discussion.

## DESIGN

Ive decided to stick to what im use to as far as a user interface. A basic menu, with multiple options, granted via Switch, While loop, and method calling.

## TECHNOLOGIES

* Eclipse
* Sublime
* Git/GitHub
* Zsh/Unix
* MacOS Terminal

* Encapsulation
* Polymorphism
* Casting

## CONCEPTS

O.O.P is a very tricky concept to grasp, but as time is progressing as well as my skillset. It has become something I find myself understanding more easily. Given the vast amount of source material, and resources given to me. Stack Overflow, Oracle.
It has become a very strong usage of referring to previous discussions and topics within the cohort.
Parameters are your best friend. As well as Arrays.
Simplicity is key, but with still being a new fresh mind into the program, ive caught myself over complicating the most basic functions time and time again because im so eager to push forward and see whats really lying up ahead. 
Once another method or lesson gets taught, i definelty want to return to the project(s) just to see if i can challenge myself to rewrite them in a more proficent manner.
